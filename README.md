# MovieRecommender
Uses unsupervised machine learning to make movie recommendations for a given input of movie(s).

# Instructions
> A "main.py" will be added to make the application more useable without a Jupyter Notebook and without modifying any code.
> 
The best way to try out the project currently is to download the project file and run the Jupyter Notebook "movie_recommender.ipynb".
This can be done via Google Collab or locally using an IDE with support for Jupyter notebooks.

Another option is to run the "movie_recommender.py" script. This will require you to modify the array of titles in the script to change 
the input for the algorithm.

# Report
The original iteration of this project was done as a final project for the Machine Learning Course CS412 at UIC. The "report.pdf" file 
is the final report that was submitted explaining the project. However, I personally have iterated on the project after this point and
will continue to in this repository. The initial commit was approximately the state of the project as discussed in the report.

### Contributors
- Tyler Limbach (myself) - Wrote a large section of the code and notebook, namely most of the recommendation algorithm. Wrote part of the report. Independently continuing development after the project report.
- Sarang Gawane - The other contributer to the code and notebook. Found and cleaned the dataset used in our original iteration, and implemented
the initial part of the algorithm.
- Mirac Kara - Wrote part of the report and contributed to design discussion.
- Sanjay Kalindini - Wrote part of the report and contributed to design discussion.
