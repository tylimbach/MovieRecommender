# MovieRecommender
Uses unsupervised machine learning to make movie recommendations for a given input of movie(s).

# Instructions
> Note: Error handling and input validation has not been implemented yet, so please use exact titles found on iMDB when entering movies to avoid crashes.

(Optional) Activate a virtualenv in your terminal.
1. Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt to your virtual env or base python installation. This can be done with pip in your terminal: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run the main.py script in the project directory to test the program. 

You can also check out the Jupyter notebook .ipynb file, but this file is not being updated further and is not recommended for most users.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Add input validation & error/exception handling
- [ ] Implement a form of autocomplete or title matching for input (e.g. "Did you mean one of these movies? _lists title choices_")

# Report
The original iteration of this project was done as a final project for the Machine Learning Course CS412 at UIC. The "report.pdf" file 
is the final report that was submitted explaining the project. However, I personally have iterated on the project after this point and
will continue to in this repository. The initial commit was approximately the state of the project as discussed in the report.

### Contributors
- Tyler Limbach (myself) - Wrote a large section of the code and notebook, namely most of the recommendation algorithm. Wrote part of the report. Independently continuing development after the project report.
- Sarang Gawane - The other contributer to the code and notebook. Found and cleaned the dataset used in our original iteration, and implemented
the initial part of the algorithm.
- Mirac Kara - Wrote part of the report and contributed to design discussion.
- Sanjay Kalindini - Wrote part of the report and contributed to design discussion.
